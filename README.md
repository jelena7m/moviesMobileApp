List of libraries used:

    - react-native-svg (React Native doesnâ€™t provide default support for SVG and can't render SVGs directly, so we need to use library for displaying SVGs)

    - react-native-svg-transformer (React Native SVG transformer allows you to import SVG files in your React Native project the same way that you would in a Web application when using a library like SVGR to transform your imported SVG images into React components.)

    - react-native-fast-image (FastImage is an Image replacement that solves issues like: flickering, cache misses, low performance loading from cache. FastImage is a wrapper around SDWebImage (iOS) and Glide (Android))

    - react-native-config (Module to expose config variables to your javascript code in React Native, supporting iOS, Android and Windows)
